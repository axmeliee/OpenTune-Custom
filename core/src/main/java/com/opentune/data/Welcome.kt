 * Whether the first-run welcome (pick artists, choose a look, sign in) is

 * every phone updating from an older version does, never sees it unless
 * they ask for it again in Settings.
 *
 * The question is settled once, at the first start that finds it open, and
 * kept in settings, so a welcome left halfway is shown again rather than
 * judged anew from the artists it has already followed.
